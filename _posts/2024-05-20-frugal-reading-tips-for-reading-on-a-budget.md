So you wanna read more.

Maybe you're trying to unplug more often. Or maybe you read a blog post about leadership and bought into the old adage that leaders read.

Whatever the case, you want to get your face in more books and digital content worth following. But money's tight, or maybe you just want to spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.

Regardless of your situation, I have some tips I'll now share for reading more on the cheap. <!--more-->

## Your local library

If you really want to save money while reading, you have to start with your local library. Otherwise, you're doing yourself a great disservice.

You may be able to get cards for libraries beyond your local library. Some libraries in Texas participate in the [TexShare](https://www.tsl.texas.gov/texshare/card) program which gives you access to libraries across the state.

Also, some libraries, like the [Houston Public Library](https://houstonlibrary.org/mylink) will give you a digital library card just for being a Texas resident.

I can't speak for similar programs in other states. But these examples show why it may pay to ask or search around for similar offerings in your own state.

### Physical books and audiobooks

When people think of their local library, they probably first think of physical books and audiobooks. And for good reason.

While libraries have digital services (more on that below), they're still a great source for getting free access to physical reading (and listening) materials.

### OverDrive/Libby

If you prefer reading ebooks, or listening to audiobooks on your phone, then you have to see if your local library offers access to [OverDrive](https://www.overdrive.com/apps). And if they do, also check that they offer [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby).

With Libby, you can read ebooks directly on your phone with the app, or you can send them to your Kindle. (I'm not sure if Libby works with other strict ereader devices, such as anything by Kobo).

With OverDrive and Libby, checking out books is as easy as buying them from the Kindle store. They're delivered straight to your device and are automatically returned after they've expired.

(A little birdie once told me that you can keep your ebooks beyond their expiration if you keep your device disconnected from the internet. But I can neither confirm nor deny.)

### Free digital subscriptions

Libraries offer so much, it's hard to keep up with all of it. And so, many of their offerings go unused.

Your local library may offer more digital subscriptions than you realize. For example, the Houston Public Library offers a ton of [digital subscriptions](https://houstonlibrary.org/az/databases).

Many of these subscriptions are for big-name content providers, such as:

- *The New York Times*
- *The Wall Street Journal*
- *The Economist* via the [PressReader](https://about.pressreader.com/) app.

You might have to jump through some hoops like re-applying for a subscription every few days. But that's not the worst thing in the world, considering the price.

## Local retail

Always be on the lookout for local retail stores, especially those that sell secondhand books.

### Physical discount store

When I was in Midland, I fell in love with the now shuttered Miss B's Books. You never knew what you'd find in stock, and that was part of the fun.

You can also check out places like Half Price Books, which does a great job of living up to its name. I'm quite fond of their clearance section, where I often find something that interests me, for $3 or less.

### Book sales hosted by your library or local Friends of the Public Library chapter

I've been known to go a little crazy at the sales hosted by the local Friends of the Public Library chapters.

These sales usually have ridiculous prices, in the line:

 - $2 for hardcover books
 - $1 for paperbacks
 - $0.50 for children's books

The details will vary, but you should get the idea.

Some of these books are library books removed from circulation, or they may be title donated by patrons. 

Also, some libraries will have 'book nooks', where they display some books they've removed from circulation that you can get at similar prices.

## Online shopping

Sometimes you just can't find what you want in person. So you turn to the World Wide Web.

### Thriftbooks

[ThriftBooks](https://www.thriftbooks.com/) has some ridiculous prices. I can often get books I'm interested in for around $3 a piece. You get [free shipping](https://www.thriftbooks.com/s/free-shipping/) on domestic orders over $15.

Your reading list will never be empty again.

### Kindle wishlist

Kindle ebooks can add up fast. But if you're patient, you can often get some great deals.

When I still read on the Kindle, I filled up my Kindle wishlist and I'd check it often. Many days, I could find an item on my wishlist on sale for $3. 

These deals might not be available exactly when you want them. But there's a good chance they'll come around at some point.

## Digital reading

Books aren't the only place to find great reading material. 

### RSS

Everyone should be using RSS to combat the unwanted effects of [social media engagement algorithms](/social-media-engagement-algorithms-and-the-illusion-of-choice).

Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HNUqDL-pI8?si=-GyJ24NXZ-iyDCZQ) if you're unfamiliar with RSS.

You can use RSS for free by saving your feeds locally. I like to use an RSS service that will save my feeds, just in case I blow up my computer, as I'm known to do. For a third-party RSS service, you can't go wrong with [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) or [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com/).

### Read-it-later services

If you use RSS, you're likely going to want to pair it with a read-it-later service. These services are where you save articles you're interested in but don't have the time to read right now. You could leave these articles in your RSS reader. But sending them to a read-it-later service makes managing your digital to-read list easier. And you can use your read-it-later service to keep up with articles you found outside your RSS feeds.

You're likely already familiar with read-it-later services like Pocket or Instapaper. But if you want a great free read-it-later option, then you should check out [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app). As an added bonus, you can use Omnivore to sync article highlights and notes to your personal knowledge management app, such as [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).

## Get to reading

If you're serious about reading more, you now have no excuse. So start filling that idea machine with fuel.
