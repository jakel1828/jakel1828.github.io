Ah, the end of the year. A time to reflect on the year that was, and to look ahead to the year that will be. <!--more-->

Below I'll share the 5 questions I expect to see answered in 2025, and 4 intentions for how I want to live in the new year.

Why not share 5 questions and 5 intentions for symmetry's sake? Dunno.

With that said, let's get to it.

## 5 Questions for 2025
Rather than make predictions about the year ahead, I want to look ahead at the stories that I'll be keeping an eye on as the new year unfolds.

### 1. Will the generative AI bubble burst?
It has to, right? To be fair, I likely thought the same thing heading into 2024.

But this year feels different. For one, more big names in AI are admitting that [generative AI is hitting a wall](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/which-ceo-will-be-the-last-to-see). 

When I say I'm hesitant to call the bursting of the bubble, it's not because I think generative AI will prove to be useful and profitable; it's because I worry the tech will continue to be propped up by an industry desperate for its next hypergrowth market, with no obvious alternative in sight.

To be clear: I won't celebrate if the bubble does burst, because I'm worried about the implications for the broader economy, as [the tech sector has bolstered the S&P 500](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ai-stock-market-outlook-magnificent-big-tech-bill-smead-rates-2023-11) for the last couple years or so. (I'm thinking about this [scene from *The Big Short*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k5aVLi_yhM).)

### 2. Will Google be broken up?
Like everyone else, I'm curious about the reality of what a second Trump presidency looks like. And I'm especially curious what it means in terms of regulating the tech industry, keeping in mind that the crypto industry donated a lot of money for Trump. And they're gonna be calling in some favors. But does that matter? How do the crypto bros feel about breaking up Google?

### 3. Can Bluesky keep winning?
In the last quarter of 2024, [Bluesky appeared to cement itself](/is-this-blueskys-time) as *the* Twitter alternative.

But how solid is its foundation? Growth brings more, [new issues](https://tedium.co/2024/12/17/bluesky-impersonation-risks/).

Is Bluesky up for the challenge? I expect we'll learn in 2025.

### 4. Will we see another crypto crash?
As I'm writing this, one Bitcoin costs just under $100,000.

Oh, how far we've come since the great crypto crash of late 2022.

Despite the epic rebound, I'm still not a believer in crypto and feel that the industry has to cool down again at some point. Is 2025 that year? How worried should we be if the generative AI *and* crypto bubbles burst in the same year?

### 5. Will MobiScribe shut its doors?

I wanted to love my MobiScribe Wave, the e-ink writing tablet I bought last year. And for a minute, I did love it, until [the device's limitations](/mobiscribe-wave-the-e-ink-writing-tablet-i-want-to-recommend-but-cant) became too much.

Back in the summer, the company promised to be more responsive via [a post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mobiscribe/comments/1dqdzc3/comment/landcyl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). But customers have yet to see any improvement, and I doubt we will see any in the future. Oh well, at least the device was cheap.

## 4 Intentions for 2025
Below are the ways I plan on working on myself at the turn of the decade.

### 1. Live more artistically
I'm over reality. Reality sucks.

Gimme art, baby.

Reality is absurd. So give me absurd art.

I want to draw and write and paint. I want to create.

Give me fountain pens and ink and notebooks and colored pencils and brushes and get out of my way and let me work.

### 2. Live more on paper.
I have this nasty habit of living in my own head. I try to juggle and store everything up in that glorified hat rack above my neck. This is a horrible method for processing (information, emotions, etc.).

I've recently grown to greater appreciate a couple benefits that paper offers:

- Writing is for processing.
- Sketching is for meditation.

Sketching is about observing, while writing is about working your way through whatever's bothering you. I need more of both of these practices in 2025.

### 3. Start reading consistently again.
In the second half of 2024, I've had a hard time reading books. The old brain just ain't working too good in that regard.

But I won't give up. I'll keep throwing a book in my face until my reading muscles start flexing again.

### 4. Create a new webcomic.
I'm dusting off my old domain and reusing it for a webcomic I'm calling [Flirting with Nihilism](https://flirtingwithnihilism.com).

---
**NOTE:** Flirting with Nihilism was the name of my blog when I resumed blogging in 2018.
---

I want to make my own version of [Hyperbole and a Half](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/) and [Sarah's Scribbles](https://sarahcandersen.com/)--a space where I can express my frustrations about the absurdities of the world.

I have a loose idea for the style and theme, but I haven't released anything yet.

So, that said, it's time to wrap up this post and get to work.

Best wishes for 2025!
