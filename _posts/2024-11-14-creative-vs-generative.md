What qualifies as creativity?

That's the question I've been asking since seeing the below [toot from Gary Marcus](https://sigmoid.social/@garymarcus/113448133255210901).

![Screenshot from Gary Marcus about how generative AI doesn't make you more creative](images/screenshot-gary-marcus-on-mastodon.png) <!--more-->

How much work does one need to put into something before he can consider himself creative? How much of creativity can be automated or outsourced before it becomes something else entirely?

Hiring someone on Fiverr to design your logo isn't considered a creative act. (We call such practice 'delegating'.) 

So why should the act of telling a computer to design that same logo ever be considered creative?

You could argue that an artist using an iPad isn't as creative as the artist using a sketchbook. You could say the same about a writer who uses a laptop versus the writer who uses pen and paper. 

But in both cases--the artist using an iPad, and the writer using a laptop--a human is still very much involved. But it's harder to say the same about the person who uses generative AI to make something.

Where's that line, and what point have we crossed it?
