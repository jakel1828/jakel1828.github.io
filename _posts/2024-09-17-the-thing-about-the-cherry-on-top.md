What will be your life's sweetest dessert? <!--more-->

I recently rewatched a video related to the prolific band The Cure being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

No, it wasn't a video of Trent Reznor's flattering [induction speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xpyxh1Q0ZI&pp=ygUjdGhlIGN1cmUgcm9jayBhbmQgcm9sbCBoYWxsIG9mIGZhbWU%3D). It was the one of the overly excited TV personality asking frontman Robert Smith if he was as excited as she was. Smith pretty much [shrugged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=houFuiYrEi0&pp=ygUtdGhlIGN1cmUgcm9jayBhbmQgcm9sbCBoYWxsIG9mIGZhbWUgaW50ZXJ2aWV3) her off.

How could he be so chill about such a major accomplishment? I'd say inclusion in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is the cherry on top of the sundae that is an awesome musical career.

The cherry is usually the first part of the sundae you eat. Credentials like being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame might be one of the first things people mention when they talk about certain bands. Many bios of The Cure will likely mention this accomplishment early on, maybe even in the opening line. 

But the cherry isn't the sweetest part of the sundae. It's not the part you get excited about. Sure, you expect the cherry. But you don't order the sundae for the cherry; you order it for the ice cream and the chocolate syrup and the whipped cream.

What do you think is sweeter: the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, or knowing you recorded *Disintegration*, [the best album ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_tFkXgRgQc)?

You can still have a sundae without a cherry; but a cherry does not a sundae make.
