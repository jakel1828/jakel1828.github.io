On this blog, I recently made the case for why [writers should kill more trees](/writers-should-kill-more-trees). <!--more-->

That sentiment doesn't apply only to writers. It applies to artists too. Drawers. Sketchers. Whoever.

Art can connect. Art can heal. Art can save. 

So we need more of it. And we need it fast. 

Now. 

Yesterday.

Sure, you might feel bad about the cost of making more art: All those dead trees. But remember that any tree you spare is destined to be part of someone else's [TPS report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy3rjQGc6lA).
