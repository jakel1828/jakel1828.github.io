## Key takeaways
- "A copywriter is a salesperson behind a typewriter."
- Don't focus on being original or creative. Instead focus on being persuasive and effective.
- Promote benefits, not features. Features are something a product does. Benefits tell what the customer gets. Benefits are why the customer should *care*.

## Thoughts
During the first few months of my current job, I've been focused on copywriting, which is uncharted territory for me. I've thought of myself as more of a content writer than a salesman. So I needed some help adapting my mindset. And I needed simple frameworks to follow. This book provided those frameworks.

At its core, copywriting is storytelling. It differs from other forms of storytelling. But at the end of the day, it's still storytelling. Copywriting is its own genre. And genre stories have formulas and expectations.

This book is a great place to learn the genre of copywriting.
