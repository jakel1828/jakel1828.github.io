Details are like salt.

A dash adds flavor. But too much kills the dish. <!--more-->

Any time there's confusion, the answer may seem to be *more detail*. But more details doesn't guarantee clarity. In fact, more detail may lead to more confusion.

Every detail is one more thing for the audience to consider and wade through. And your audience is likely too busy for all that extra work. 

It's far better if you do the work for them. You should sort through all the details and discard the useless and highlight the crucial. 

If it's not important enough for you to make sense of the details, then why should you expect your audience to do it?
