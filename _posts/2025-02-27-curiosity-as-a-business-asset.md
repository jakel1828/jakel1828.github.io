Curiosity is an underrated business asset.

Because curious people ask questions. And questions lead to new answers. <!--more-->

But businesses want to hire know-it-alls. Hiring know-it-alls is fine as long as you never run into new problems. (Old problems aren't really *problems*; they're routine. They're familiar. They don't require imagination or willingness to get out of your comfort zone.)

But new problems require diving into the unfamiliar. Problem solving requires a certain kind of bravery. *Curiosity*.

That curiosity leads to new knowledge, which leads to new insights, which leads to the *duty* to speak up, to buck the conventional 'wisdom'.

But know-it-alls have no use for curiosity. Because they already have all the answers. And those answers can most likely be found in the comfort of the status quo. So why consider anything else if you already know it all?
