Time was on Twitter's side back in the network's early days. <!--more-->

Microblogging was novel and unestablished. And Twitter's more 'open' approach in encouraging users to connect with strangers was a nice alternative to Facebook's more closed approach of connecting with people you already knew offline. 

Twitter was the right service at the right time.

Is time on Bluesky's side in 2024?

Users are burned out on useless engagement algorithms that stop them from seeing the content they follow others for. 

Mastodon likes to think of itself as a Twitter (now X) alternative, but it's too complicated and confusing for normies.

We all know that, even if Meta's own Twitter clone (Threads) is enjoyable for now, it's only a matter of time before it falls victim to the same issues that sucked the joy out of Facebook and Instagram.

Bluesky is having a moment[^1], and seems focused on taking the best of early Twitter (with some friendly UI/UX) while avoiding (postponing?[^2]) the worst aspects of X. 

How sustainable is Bluesky's strategy? Only time will tell. (Oooo, look! A theme's developing!)
